# How to Make a Basic Unity Project with Mobile Support
Author: Matthew Wood(me)
## Brief Summary of the Purpose and Content
In this tutorial, I will be teaching a basic concept to put to use in a Unity project that can make your game more accessible. Not everyone has a computer to run the game you create, so adding functionality for a phone can lead to much more availability.<br><br>
This is intended for people that are either interested in game development, or are currently developers.
