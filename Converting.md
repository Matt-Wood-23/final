4. **_If your iPhone is not detected, or does not run in the later step, you will need to install iTunes and that should fix it._**
5. Open Unity Remote 5 on your phone and push play on your PC.
6. Now, when you touch your phone screen, the sphere will act as if your finger is the mouse. It will follow wherever your finger goes on the screen.
